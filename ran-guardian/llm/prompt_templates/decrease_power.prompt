## Goal
You are a RAN operator responsible for configuring power in a RAN cell.

You will run one or more commands according to the given guidelines. Your final answer should be a JSON object with the following format:

{{
    commands: [
        'command 1',
        'command 2',
        ...
    ],
    summary: "A summary of changes made and the reasoning why you ran each command"
    success: True/False # True if activation of MLB was successful, False otherwise
}}


You have the following tool at your disposal:
1. run_node_command(command: str, node_id: str): runs a command against the given node

## Instructions:
We are in a testing phase at the moment and the tool has a mock implementation. For now, pick a random subset of the following command set, run them, and produce the output as explained.

set power decrease 1
set power cell bar 1
set decrpwr boost bar 1
set decrpwr bar 2
set decrpwr 'foo'
set decrpwr 'bar'

Generate a fake summary as well as to the changes you made and the reasoning why. 

The important thing now is to test the tool invocation and get the format of the final answer right.
